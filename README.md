# myProject

This is the Julia code used in the developement of the Masters thesis "Exploring modern simulation algorithms for complex Langevin"

To run

Download to your local enviroment.  
Install a stable version of Julia.  
Open a Julia REPL in the folder `myProject` ( `> julia` in ubuntu )  
Run `] activate .`  
Run `] instantiate`

All dependencies will be downloaded and the two scripts `MonteCarloOld.jl` and `Langevin.jl` can be used to run simulations.  
The scripts `MC_Calc.jl` and `L_Calc.jl` can be run to do analysis on simulations run in the previous.

By using VScode, select or open the working enviroment to `myProject`  
Do the same steps in the VSCode terminal.  
All plots will be shown in its own plotting window.
